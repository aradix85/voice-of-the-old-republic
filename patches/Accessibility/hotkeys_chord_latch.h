// Whose press is it when a chord's key reaches the engine after the modifier
// is up again? The engine reads buffered, modifier-blind presses; the mod reads
// the live keyboard. A quick Ctrl+L can have Ctrl released by the time the
// engine's L arrives, the more so when the hotkey itself takes long (Ctrl+L
// plans a walk), and the engine then opens its own screen for bare L.
//
// The latch pairs the two views of one physical press: the poll notes a chord
// going down, the input hook notes an engine press it swallowed with the
// modifier still held, and whichever comes second finds the first. Short-lived,
// so it can never take a later bare press. Engine-free.
